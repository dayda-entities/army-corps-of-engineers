This geospatial dataset contains the authoritative point locations and (where available) boundaries of Department of Defense sites, commonly referred to as installations, ranges, training areas, bases, forts, camps, armories, centers, etc. These installations are, in many cases, comprised of a number of subordinate sites. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all Department of Defense facilities, and only those reported in the 2015 Base Structure Report (BSR) were considered for inclusion. Points are placed either at or near the center of each site and do not reflect any particular landmark. Boundaries encompass federally owned or otherwise managed lands, as defined in the BSR. The point and boundary location datasets are intended for planning purposes only, and do not represent the legal or surveyed land parcel boundaries.
