Polygons showing USACE Civil Works Division boundaries. This dataset was digitized from the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). Where districts follow administrative boundaries, such as County and State lines, National Atlas and Census datasets were used. USACE District GIS POCs also submitted data to incorporate into this dataset. This dataset has been simplified +/- 30 feet to reduce file size and speed up drawing time. 04/16/20 - Update to show new LRC boundary.
