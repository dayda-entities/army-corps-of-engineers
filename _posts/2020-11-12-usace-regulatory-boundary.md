The US Army Corps of Engineers has been regulating activities in the nation's waters since 1890. Until the 1960s the primary purpose of the regulatory program was to protect navigation. Since then, as a result of laws and court decisions, the program has been broadened so that it now considers the full public interest for both the protection and utilization of water resources. These boundaries represent USACE regulatory districts. Attribute information includes an address, telephone number and url for each district. Updated APR 2020.
