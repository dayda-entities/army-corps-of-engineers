A beacon is a prominent specially constructed object forming a conspicuous mark as a fixed aid to navigation or for use in hydrographic survey (IHO Dictionary, S-32, 5th Edition, 420). A lateral beacon is used to indicate the port or starboard hand side of the route to be followed. They are generally used for well defined channels and are used in conjunction with a conventional direction of buoyage. (UKHO NP 735, 5th Edition)
