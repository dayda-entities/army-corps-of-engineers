The National Channel Framework (NCF) is an enterprise Geographic Information System (eGIS) database providing information about congressionally authorized navigation channels maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers. This service includes channel details based on district-managed GIS polygons rather than on CAD-based linework, and is maintained through the eHydro hydrographic survey application. Details include reaches, channel areas, quarters, centerlines, and stationing.
