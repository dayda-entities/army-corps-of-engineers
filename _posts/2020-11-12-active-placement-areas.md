This webservice contains a dataset that was populated under the Navigation and Coastal Data Bank project. In, 2010, two data analysts were sent to the 21 coastal USACE Districts for 12 months to organize and load data. Additional placement areas were included from national programs under USACE, specifically the National Dredging Quality Management (DQM) and CE-Dredge Programs.
