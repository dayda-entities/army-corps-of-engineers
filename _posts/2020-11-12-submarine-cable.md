These data depict the occurrence of submarine cables in and around U.S. navigable waters. The purpose of this data product is to support coastal planning at the regional and national scale. Source geometry and attributes were derived from 2010 NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) and 2009 NOAA Raster Navigational Charts (RNCs) and recently updated in 2013 referencing the RNCs. Polyline features explicitly defined as cables were compiled from the original sources, exclusive of those features noted as 'cable areas'. The scale of the source material was highly variable and discontinuities between multiple sources were resolved with least possible spatial adjustments. The original S-57 data model was modified for readability and performance.
